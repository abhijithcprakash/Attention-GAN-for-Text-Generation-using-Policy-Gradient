# Attention-GAN-for-Text-Generation-using-Policy-Gradient

I developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with an attention mechanism for high-quality text generation. The attention mechanism enhances the generator's ability to focus on key parts of the input, improving context understanding and text coherence. To train the model, I applied the Policy Gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, which optimizes the generator by rewarding high-quality text generation and penalizing less accurate outputs. This approach enables the model to improve iteratively, producing more fluent and contextually relevant text. Technologies Used:PyTorch This model combines the strengths of attention mechanisms, GANs, and reinforcement learning to create a robust framework for generating high-quality text.
