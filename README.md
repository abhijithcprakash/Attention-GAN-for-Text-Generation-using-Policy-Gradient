# 🧠 Attention-GAN for Text Generation using Policy Gradient

This project presents a powerful framework combining **Attention Mechanisms**, **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, and **Reinforcement Learning (Policy Gradient)** for **high-quality text generation**.

Traditional GANs struggled with text due to the **discrete nature of language**. Our model overcomes this by treating text generation as a **sequential decision-making problem**, where the generator is trained via **Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning**, producing more fluent, coherent, and contextually relevant text.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Attention-Enhanced Generator**: The generator uses an attention mechanism to focus on crucial parts of input sequences, improving context understanding.
- **GAN Framework**: Generator vs. Discriminator setup enhances realism in generated text.
- **Policy Gradient Training**: Reinforcement Learning fine-tunes the generator, rewarding high-quality text and penalizing poor outputs.
- **Robust Pretraining**: Separate pretraining for generator and discriminator stabilizes adversarial training.

## 📈 Training Workflow

### 1. Pre-Training Phase
- **Generator Pretraining**:  
  - Trained with **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)** on real text data.
  - Helps the generator start with meaningful sequence generation.
- **Discriminator Pretraining**:  
  - Trained to distinguish between real and generated sequences.
  - Strengthens the adversarial component before full training.

### 2. GAN + RL Fusion Training
- Treats text generation as a **sequential policy**:
  - Each word generated is an **action** based on the current **state** (previous words).
- **Reward Signal**:
  - The discriminator evaluates the full sequence and provides a reward signal.
- **Policy Gradient Optimization**:
  - The generator updates its parameters to **maximize expected reward** (better, more realistic text).

## 🏗️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Attention-GAN-for-Text-Generation.git
cd Attention-GAN-for-Text-Generation
```

> Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional)**:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
```

3. **Install Required Packages**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, install manually:

```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

(You can update this depending on any additional dependencies.)

## 🧠 Running the Project

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Ensure you have the dataset ready (modify `dataset_utils.py` if needed for your dataset).

2. **Pretrain the Generator and Discriminator**:

```bash
python train.py # FUNCTION FOR TRAINING CAN BE USED
```

3. **Adversarial Training (GAN + Policy Gradient)**:

```bash
python train.py FUNCTION FOR TRAINING PG CAN BE USED
```

4. **Evaluate the Model**:

```bash
python evaluation.py
```

5. **Play Around**:
   - You can modify the architectures or switch between different discriminator variants (`discriminator.py`, `discriminator2.py`, `discriminator3.py`) for experimentation.
